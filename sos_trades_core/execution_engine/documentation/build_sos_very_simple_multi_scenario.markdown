# Documentation of the Build Very Simple Multi-Scenario driver

## Short description

The build vs_MS discipline driver is a specialisation of the vs_MS driver. 
It extends the vs_MS discipline driver by providing the capability to select in the GUI the used sub_process of the driver and also the associated scenario_map. 

The vs_MS capability is dedicated to create as many scenarios as the user needs to perform on its nested sub_process.
It creates as many instances of the sub_process as selected scenarios. 
Each instance will have its inputs and its outcome outputs (after run).

## Introduction
The vs_MS driver is dedicated to create as many scenarios as the user needs to perform on its nested sub_process.

It creates as many instances of the sub_process as selected scenarios. 

Each instance will have its inputs and its outcome outputs (after run).

It provides the capability to:
1. Step 1: Generate all the instances of disciplines based on the user's selected list of scenario names and display it in a tree view. 
2. Step 2: Then allow the user to populate the disciplines
3. Step 3: Run all disciplines 


## GUI inputs: Selected example
The selected example for this manual is a vs_MS applied to the "disc1_disc3" disciplines. There exists a SoSTrades process for this example and it can be selected as follows: 
![Example of doe process](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_01.PNG)

![Study creation](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_02.PNG)

![Tree view example](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_03.PNG)

The user is then ready to provide the inputs depending on his needs.

The user's inputs will be both:
- the selected list of scenario's names ("Scenario List" input) 
- and the inputs to each associated discipline instance of the nested sub_process

The input named as "Scenario List" may have its name customised by the user.

## What a very simple Multi Scenarios is? What/when do you need it?

### General description of a process in SoSTrades
We have a disciple that may be a SoS, i.e. be a structured set of disciplines 'Disk_j'.
It results of a list of input variables 'x_k' that may be:
- either shared (common to all disciplines) and in this case it has an associated namespace key that may have a selected value
- or local to a discipline 'Disc_j'
In this context, each variable will have a unique full name defined as a path in a tree view. 

A variable that has the same full name and belongs to two disciplines with an input/output status, is a coupled variable.

### SoSTrades trades off or scenarios
We want to create several scenarios, where a scenario is a set of 'x_k' coherent input values.
Each process will be defined by its name provided in a list ['Scenario_1', 'Scenario_2', 'Scenario_3', ...]

| Scenario      | Scenario name |               |      'x_j'        |               |               |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|      1        | 'Scenario_1'  |               | 'Scenario_1.x_j'  |               |               |
|      2        | 'Scenario_2'  |               | 'Scenario_2.x_j'  |               |               |
|      3        | 'Scenario_3'  |               | 'Scenario_3.x_j'  |               |               |
|               |               |               |                   |               |               |

### SoSTrades tree view as disciplines "per scenario nodes"
The scenario name is then added in the name of the variables and we have the following tree view.

		|_ MyStudyName
		
			|_ vs_MS
			
				|_ scenario_1
				
					|_ Disc_1
					
					|_ Disc_2
					
				|_ scenario_2
				
					|_ Disc_1
					
					|_ Disc_2

In this tree view, 
- scenario node 'scenario_i' (with the scenario name) are added. They are coupling nodes.
- 'vs_MS' is the vs_MS driver node
- 'vs_MS.scenario_i.Disc_j' is an instance of discipline 'Disc_j'
All the disciplines 'vs_MS.scenario_i.Disc_j are children of each scenario nodes 'scenario_i'.

About the input variables:
- if local:  xx
- if shared: xx

About the output variables:
- if local: xx
- if shared: xx

### SoSTrades tree view as scenario "per disciplines nodes" (called as "scatter node")

We can have the same list of scenarios, but with the tree view sorted by disciplines rather than scenarios.
The discipline name with be a "scatter node" driver in the tree, and the scario name be the discipline 'Disc_j' as a children of this scatter driver node: 

		|_ MyStudyName
		
				|_ Disc_1
				
					|_ scenario_1
					
					|_ scenario_2
					
				|_ Disc_2
				
					|_ scenario_1
					
					|_ scenario_2
In this tree view, 
- scatter node 'Disc_j' (with the disc name) are added. It is "scatter nodes".
- 'Disc_j.scenario_i' is an instance of discipline 'Disc_j'
All the disciplines Disc_j.scenario_i are children of each scatter discipline node 'Disc_j'.

this capability is provided by the SoSTrades "scatter driver" and may be depreciated in the future, as we prefer the "per scenario node" view with a "gather postreatment view" (see next section)

### "very simple MS" versus "simple MS" versus "MS" versus "Morphological Matrix Eval" drivers
Multi-scenario MS and simple MS are specialisations of "very simple MS" where the list of scenarios are automatically created and populated based on a specified list of inputs with values (see related documentation)

The "Morphological Matrix Eval" xxxx (see related documentation)

## GUI inputs/outputs
### GUI inputs: Overview
 
The overall process appears as a tree view:
- the study name: e.g. Example_vs_MS_Disc1_Disc3
- the driver name: e.g. vs_MS

![Tree view example](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_03.PNG)

The the user with select a name for each of his scenario:

![Main inputs](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_04.PNG)

The user needs to select the list of scenario names by using this "Scenario List" selector.

![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_05.PNG)


Remark:
- After configuration, he will then see all the generated instances of disciplines for each selected scenario.


		
- the tree of the nested subprocess: (Disc1,Disc3) with as many instances and names as we have values in the "Scenario List" input.

![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_06.PNG)


The "Scenario List" will usually be placed in the tree view at the vs_MS driver node (however its namescape defined by the "input_ns" value in the "Scatter build map", can be put somewhere else).

There are other parameters associated with the vs_MS driver:
- it can be the "autogather" boolean value but it is hidden in the driver creation process
- it can be the "input_ns" value but it is hidden in the driver creation process
- it can be the "ns_to_update " with the list of namespace that have to be taken into account (to avoid collision of outputs): this list may be computed by SoSTrades in a future evolution and not be anymore a process input


### GUI inputs: data input for each instance of the nested sub_process
The user NEEDs also to provide value for each input variable of each instance of the nested subprocess.
For example, in case of this  example: 
![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_07.PNG)
![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_12.PNG)
![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_08.PNG)
![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_09.PNG)

### GUI: run
When all inputs data have been provided, and saved, the user can run the vs_MS, that goes from the configuration state, to Pending and Done (or Failure with error message if something goes wrong). 

![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_13.PNG)
![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_11.PNG)

### GUI outputs: 
Then the user can see and post-treat the results.
In the output section of each instance of the nested process, he will find the values of each output variable.


Those variables will be put in the treeview in a location that will depend on their namespace.

In our example, the outputs are the following:
![Eval in](./sos_vs_MS_png/vs_MS_10.PNG)

### GUI outputs: Option "autogather" = True

When "autogather" = True in the process, then an output node is added in the tree view with the "gather_node" name provided in the driver process.

All the output values (for all the scenarios) are gathered at this node.

## Builder process: main parameters
- driver_name: it is a string that is set to 'vs_MS' by default. It is the name of the instance of the vs_MS driver
- autogather: it is a boolean that is set to False by default. When set to yes, then gathering of output results are provided in the tree view on an added 'gather node'.
- gather_node: it is a string only used if autogather = True. It provide the name of the 'gather node' in the tree view: i.e. 'Post-processing'
- business_post_proc: boolean that is set to False by default.
- builder_list: it is the class builder of the nested sub_process
- scenario_map_name: it is a string. It is the name of the "Scatter build map" needed to define the management of the list of scenarios and associated namespace of variable and wanted structure. 
See the dedicated section.

## Appendix: from a mathematical point of view
The vs_MS driver is dedicated to create as many scenarios as have been provided in a defined map:

vsMS:

		List of scenario names -> Design Space of the nested process

		scenario_name |-> point in the design Space

It is realised by creating a dedicated discipline instance per scenario name:

		List of scenario names -> set of discipline objects

		scenario_name |-> a discipline instance with a unique name based on its scenario name


We can then denotes each family by the label of the scenarios:
- the family of scenario inputs $(x_{<scenario\_name>})$
- the family of process instances $(P_{<scenario\_name)}>$
- and the associated outputs by $(y_{<scenario\_name>})$, where $$y_{<scenario\_name>} = P_{<scenario\_name>}(x_{<scenario\_name>})$$.
