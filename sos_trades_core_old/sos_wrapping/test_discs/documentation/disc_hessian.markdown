# The Hessian discipline
It is a general quadratic equation of two variables:

$z=a_{x2} x^2 +b_{y2} y^2 + c_{x} x + d_{y} y + e_{xy} xy$


The two variables are the input variables $x$ and $y$. 

The coefficients are the inputs variables $a_{x2}$, $b_{y2}$, $c_{x}$, $d_{y}$ and $e_{xy}$.

The output is the variable $z$.
